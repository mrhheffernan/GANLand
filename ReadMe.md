# GANLand

A series of introductory Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) used to demonstrate usage
and familiarity.

These are built in PyTorch and will walk through examples, beginning with a simple
implementation and developing this to more complex applications.

## SimpleGAN

Implementing a introductory GAN tutorial to demonstrate learning of a simple
1-D distribution.

Added more explanatory comments to the code and some simple visualization,
can return to compare behavior in different distributions.
